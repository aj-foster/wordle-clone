# Wordle Clone

Small Wordle game written in React.

It can...

- Pick a word from a hard-coded corpus
- Allow typing and checking your guess
- Determine if you've won or lost
- Restart the game with a different word

It cannot...

- Check the validity of guesses as "real words" — we'd need a much bigger corpus for this.
- Keep track of your history. This was out of scope.
